Now for the first time in history, all the pieces of The Secret come together in a revelation that is life transforming for all who experience it.

                   <br><br> 
                If you know the foundations of the Law of Attraction, but you’re still not feeling 100% comfortable with it… if you started getting some results, but you know you’re not tapping into your full potential yet… Then this course will teach you how to start manifesting effectively by using one of the most powerful tools you already have — your intuition. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Origins” will reconnect you with the original source of abundance you had as a child, without negative conditions limiting your power. It will introduce you to the Intention Point — explaining what it is and how to use it to strengthen your manifestations. It will also give you IPA (Intention Point Accelerators) techniques and exercises to not only put theory into practice, but also to get the results faster.
                    <br><br>
All of it delivered in multimedia form (video, audio, text) on our user-friendly membership platform — which you can access online anytime you want. These materials are yours to keep for life.

                    <br><br> 
                    1) your health and well-being;<br> 2) your relationship with money and;<br> 3) your power of manifestation. 
                    <br><br> As usual, you’ll get a package of practical lessons, exercises, quizzes and worksheets. You can choose your pace and complete this journey in 3 weeks, 90 days or whatever works best for you.

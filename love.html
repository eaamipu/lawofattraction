                        <p class="intro_text">If you’re looking to learn how to manifest love fast, the key message you need to internalize is that you have to start looking for love with real intention.
                            
                            <br><br>
                            
                            What this means is that you must learn how to align yourself with a vibrational frequency that can attract love rather than further disappointment, and that you need to develop a vivid, clear sense of what you’re actually trying to do when you aim to manifest love.

                        <p class="intro_text ">Many of us never refine our concept of what looking for love means. The Universe can’t help us find love if we don’t really know what we actually want. Here are four ways to start looking for love with real intention today.

                        <br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text">Essentially, you need to make the decision that you really want to attract this life partner. Then, truly commit to the idea of spending the rest of your life with this person. Making this commitment may involve processing old wounds (e.g. via journaling or therapy). Hopefully, the past can be left behind and you can opt to embrace hope instead of fear.
<br><br>
Once you’ve made your decision, a big part of understanding how to manifest love with a specific person lies in getting a clear sense of what it is about this person that makes you believe that looking for love with them will truly make you happy. As such, part of making a manifestation commitment involves beginning to analyze yourself in a new, deeper way.
<br><br>
However, an important cautionary note is that you absolutely must set realistic expectations. It’s not possible to manifest love with a “perfect” person because there is no such thing as a perfect person. You have to be willing to find love with someone who is perfect for you but who has some flaws and difficulties nonetheless.

<br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text ">There’s an old cliché that claims you can’t love others unless you love yourself. However, there is truth in this saying. It can have a major impact on whether you’re able to successfully manifest love.
<br><br>
Specifically, you attract love with people who are aligned with your vibrational state. So if you are down on yourself or lack confidence, you often find love only with people who treat you poorly and fail to recognize your worth. Therefore, looking for love with real intention requires you to form a deeper, more profound and accepting connection with yourself.
                            <br><br>
Whether or not you feel it right now, everyone contains the essence of love. This is an infinite resource that you can draw on at all times… Not just when you’re looking for love.

HERE ARE SOME TIPS THAT WILL HELP YOU DEVELOP THIS SELF-LOVE, ENABLING YOU TO MANIFEST LOVE WITH YOUR SOUL MATE:
</h3>
<br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text ">Become the person you want to attract.
Take another look at the life partner you designed according to all the key qualities you value.
                            <br><br>
                            Next, try to think of how you can cultivate those precise traits in yourself. For example, if ambition is on your list, ask yourself how you can work harder to achieve your goals (in work, and in life more broadly).
<br><br>
Make time for self-care.
                            <br><br>
Learning how to connect with yourself has a lot to do with tuning into your own need. Consequently, then meeting those needs. When you make a habit of this, you’re much more able to attract love with someone who will nurture you. One way to ensure you take better care of yourself while you’re looking for love is to set aside an hour a day where you commit to pursuing a hobby you love! This should be no matter what other, more “productive” things you could be doing.
<br><br>
Challenge your limiting beliefs. 
                            <br><br>
As with all Law of Attraction work, trying to manifest love requires you look at the underlying assumption that holds you back. In this case, limiting beliefs that might block you from finding love. Try to write them down first. Then identify where they came from. Most importantly, write down a contradictory belief that you can then turn into a daily affirmation.

                        <h3 class="menu_text">STEP 3 – LET THE UNIVERSE KNOW YOU ARE READY</h3>
<br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text ">It’s time to let the universe know you’re truly ready to manifest your soulmate. Simply coming into a more positive vibrational alignment can certainly help you find love. 
                            <br><br>
                            However, there’s also a specific process you can follow to help you attract love more quickly. These steps will open you up to a soul-deep connection with the specific person you want to find love with:
<br><br>
Set a clear intention.
                            <br><br>
First, write something down until you get the words right. Then when you’re happy, say them out loud as you look at yourself in the mirror. Some examples include “I am ready to manifest love and I open my heart to my one true soulmate” and “My mind is clear, my heart is open, and I am ready to welcome my soulmate in.”
<br><br>
Affirm your belief in your soulmate.
                            <br><br>
While you’ve already worked hard to combat limiting beliefs and create a clear image of the person you want to be with, you make it easier for the Universe to send that person your way if you constantly stay connected to your belief that they exist.
                            <br><br>
                            Try daily affirmations (written or spoken) like “I am looking for love, and my soulmate is on their way to me”. Plus, “Nothing will stop me from receiving the love of my soulmate.”
                            <br><br>

Multi-sensory visualization.
                            <br><br>
                            Take your creative visualization further and begin to spend longer daily sessions imagining every aspect of being with your soulmate. The stronger this mental image, the stronger the pull you will exert on them.
                            <br><br>
                            Think not only about how they will look but also how they will sound, smell and feel. You might also try picturing significant moments in your life. For example, visualize events like sharing a bed for the first time, getting married or having children.

<br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text ">
                            As you work to manifest your soulmate, the final stage of your journey to attract love involves cultivating patience. Embrace this sense of peace as you accept that the Universe can – and will – give you what you need.
                            <br><br>
                            Although you’ve been focusing on how to manifest love with a specific person, looking for love through Law of Attraction techniques rests on your ability to trust that the Universe knows exactly what kind of partner can help you manifest love that lasts.
                            <br><br>
                            Don’t fret about when you’re going to find your soulmate. But rather, rest easy in the knowledge that you will find them at the perfect time.

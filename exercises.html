                        <br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text">Make your very own ‘manifesting shopping list’. Every day, no matter where you  go, scribble out lists of what you want from the universe.
Write them on your phone, on scraps of paper or in a beautiful notebook bought specifically for the task. Writing lists like this will help you to get really clear on what it is that you want.
                            <br><br>
However, the biggest advantage of this exercise is that the more you lose and forget about your lists, the easier it will become for these things to manifest in your life.
When we focus really hard on waiting for something to show up in our lives, our energies can become ones of worry and ‘lack’ – creating resistance.
                            <br><br>
So, once we have got clear on what it is that we want and forget about our lists, we let our dreams go. This takes all pressure off of the manifesting process, leaving our dreams in the hands of the universe.
Other exercises that embrace your creative visualizations also include using a vision board, creating a focus wheel or even writing a dream journal.

                        <br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text ">Taking some time out to play in the realms of your imagination with creative visualization exercises, can prove a fun and simple exercise for raising your feel-good vibrations.
                          <br><br>  
Plus, it helps to tell the universe exactly what it is you wish to manifest in your life.
                            <br><br>
Try spending 10-15 minutes imagining how your perfect day would go. What would you be doing? What would you look like? Who would you spend your time with? Enjoy exploring the life that you know you are in the process of creating.

                        <br><br>
                        <p class="intro_text">Practice manifesting something small, to give yourself confidence and help hone your creating capabilities.
                            <br><br>
Begin by trying to manifest something small and even insignificant – it could be anything from a distinctive flower to a book.
                            <br><br>
You want to start small as you need something that you have no resistance to, something you feel no pressure to manifest.
<br><br>
Now, spend a couple of minutes thinking about this item. How will you feel when you have it? How will it feel in your hand? Just relax and let it fill your thoughts for a few moments.

                        <p class="intro_text ">Last but not least, forget about it. Let it go, and rather than worry about whether this thing will show up or not, look forward to it unexpectedly popping up in your life.
                                <br><br>
Simple beginners’ practices such as these can help to raise your frequency and bring your mind to a place of positivity and better alignment with your goals.
                                <br><br>
Further still, as evidence of the Law of Attraction begins to crop up in your day-to-day life your confidence will begin to grow, until you are able to begin manifesting even bigger and greater things.
